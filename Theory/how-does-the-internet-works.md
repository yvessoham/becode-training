# How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes

The internet is not a bubble cloud.
the internet is a wire buried in the ground.
the internet is usefull because 2 computers connected toi the same wire can communicate. 
aserver is a special computer connected directly to the internet

every server has a unique protocol address. 
the IP address works like a postal address. It helps computer to find each other.
for example a IP adress is 
1. google.com

2. facebook.com  
![facebook](https://media.tenor.com/J4wQKYOXU8AAAAAC/facebook.gif)
3. and so on... 

OUr computer at home is not a server because it's not connectecd directly to the internet. the home computer is called client because it's indirectly connected to the internt.

When you want to visit a website or send a message to a friend on the Internet, your computer sends small pieces of information called "packets" through these secret routes. The packets contain instructions about what you want to do.

There are special mailboxes called "routers" along these secret routes. Routers are like delivery agents that help the packets find their way to the right home (computer). They read the IP addresses on the packets and guide them in the right direction.

When your packets reach their destination, like a website, the computer on the other end puts them together to form the page you see on your screen. It's like sending a puzzle in a box, and once it arrives, it's assembled to display an image.

So, the next time you use the Internet, remember that behind the screen, there's a whole network of secret road, computers, and routers working together to enable you to do all sorts of cool things online. It's like a big virtual adventure!
